Gaurav5:24:23 PM
yes

VirtualCarolyn5:24:25 PM
Let's get started.

VirtualCarolyn5:24:27 PM
Introduction

VirtualCarolyn5:24:27 PM
Where is the temperature cooler in regards to a Cold front?

VirtualCarolyn5:24:37 PM
Okay, Gaurav. Can you say a little more about that?

Timmy5:24:37 PM
in front of the cold front

VirtualCarolyn5:24:41 PM
That is incorrect.

VirtualCarolyn5:24:41 PM
Remember that temperature fronts indicate the temperature behind the front. Where is 
         the temperature cooler in regards to a Low front?

Timmy5:25:00 PM
In front

VirtualCarolyn5:25:07 PM
The temperature cooler behind in regards to a Low front

VirtualCarolyn5:25:07 PM
Let's move on to other topics.

VirtualCarolyn5:25:07 PM
When warm and cold fronts meet, there is likely to be a Low Pressure center. That 
         means the temperature at these intersections is… ?

Timmy5:25:24 PM
cooler

Gaurav5:25:25 PM
high

VirtualCarolyn5:25:27 PM
That is correct.

VirtualCarolyn5:25:27 PM
Let's move on to other topics.

Please join in.

Germán5:27:03 PM

Gaurav5:27:28 PM
let's talk about precipitation

Gaurav5:27:44 PM
german will you like to say something about it

VirtualCarolyn5:27:49 PM
:-)

VirtualCarolyn5:28:05 PM
You can discuss about LP_PRECIPITATION. If you want to discuss LP_PRECIPITATION with me say 'let's discuss LP_PRECIPITATION'

VirtualCarolyn5:28:07 PM
Do you have any thoughts, Germán?

Germán5:29:09 PM
let's discuss LP_PRECIPITATION

VirtualCarolyn5:29:11 PM

               Will you like to answer some questions related to low pressure and precipitation ?
        

Timmy5:29:19 PM
yes

VirtualCarolyn5:29:21 PM
Let's get started.

VirtualCarolyn5:29:23 PM
Introduction

VirtualCarolyn5:29:23 PM
Where does the air move in a low pressure center?

Timmy5:29:28 PM
upward

VirtualCarolyn5:29:31 PM
That is correct.

VirtualCarolyn5:29:31 PM
When air is pushed upward, what happens to it?

Germán5:29:42 PM
does the air get cooler?

VirtualCarolyn5:29:47 PM
Can you rephrase your response?

VirtualCarolyn5:29:47 PM
When air is pushed upward, what happens to it?

Germán5:30:00 PM
it gets cooler

VirtualCarolyn5:30:01 PM
That is incorrect.

VirtualCarolyn5:30:01 PM
When air rises, it is introduced to higher pressure and cooler 
           temperatures. What happens to air under high pressure and cooler temperatures?

Germán5:30:59 PM
the air is pushed down

VirtualCarolyn5:31:01 PM
When air rises and it is introduced to higher pressure and cooler 
           temperatures, it gets condensed.

VirtualCarolyn5:31:01 PM
What is the result of air condensing?

Germán5:31:26 PM
precipitation

VirtualCarolyn5:31:27 PM
Can you rephrase your response?

VirtualCarolyn5:31:27 PM
What is the result of air condensing?

Germán5:31:38 PM
the result of air condensing is precipitation

VirtualCarolyn5:31:43 PM
That is incorrect.

VirtualCarolyn5:31:43 PM
When water vapor condenses, it goes from being a gas to being a liquid. What is the result of air condensing in low pressure centers?

VirtualCarolyn5:32:05 PM
You can discuss about LP_TEMPERATURE. If you want to discuss LP_TEMPERATURE with me say 'let's discuss LP_TEMPERATURE'

VirtualCarolyn5:32:07 PM
hey Gaurav, are you still with us?

Gaurav5:32:14 PM
yes I am

VirtualCarolyn5:32:19 PM
Can you rephrase your response?

VirtualCarolyn5:32:19 PM
When water vapor condenses, it goes from being a gas to being a liquid. What is the result of air condensing in low pressure centers?

Timmy5:32:29 PM
moisture and clouds

VirtualCarolyn5:32:35 PM
That is correct.

VirtualCarolyn5:32:35 PM
Since there is more moisture and clouds, the chance of precipitation in a low pressure center is...?

Gaurav5:32:49 PM
high

VirtualCarolyn5:32:55 PM
That is correct.

VirtualCarolyn5:32:55 PM
Let's move on to other topics.

Germán5:33:20 PM

Gaurav5:33:32 PM

VirtualCarolyn5:33:33 PM

               Will you like to answer some questions related to warm front and temperature ?
        

Gaurav5:34:05 PM
yes

VirtualCarolyn5:34:07 PM

Germán5:35:07 PM
ok

Germán5:36:31 PM
so i think warm front is when massive warm air replaces cold air

Gaurav5:37:09 PM
Virtual carolyn let's discuss warm front and temperature

Gaurav5:39:32 PM
ok i think some issue with warm front and temperature script

Gaurav5:39:44 PM
we should talk about something else

Gaurav5:39:51 PM
Timmy any ideas ?

Timmy5:40:05 PM
cold front and wind direction

Gaurav5:40:25 PM
i think script broke we need to start again

Since there is more moisture and clouds, the chance of precipitation in a low pressure center is...?

VirtualCarolyn1:23:55 PM
That is incorrect.

           temperatures. What happens to air under high pressure and cooler temperatures?

Germán5:30:59 PM
the air is pushed down

VirtualCarolyn5:31:01 PM
When air rises and it is introduced to higher pressure and cooler 
           temperatures, it gets condensed.

VirtualCarolyn5:31:01 PM
What is the result of air condensing?

Germán5:31:26 PM

VirtualCarolyn5:31:27 PM
Can you rephrase your response?

Where is the temperature cooler in regards to a Cold front?

Timmy6:05:04 PM
in front

VirtualCarolyn6:05:08 PM
That is incorrect.

VirtualCarolyn6:05:08 PM
Remember that temperature fronts indicate the temperature behind the front. Where is 
         the temperature cooler in regards to a Low front?

When warm and cold fronts meet, there is likely to be a Low Pressure center. That 
         means the temperature at these intersections is… ?

VirtualCarolyn7:57:53 PM
That is incorrect.

VirtualCarolyn7:57:53 PM
Low pressure centers are named after where there is a concentration of air in the atmosphere. Where in the the atmosphere is the concentration of a Low pressure system?

VirtualCarolyn7:58:53 PM
The concentration of air in a low pressure center is low in altitude

VirtualCarolyn7:58:53 PM
Let's move on to other topics.

VirtualCarolyn7:58:53 PM
Since the air has concentrated lower in the atmosphere, the temperature is most likely…?

VirtualCarolyn7:59:53 PM
That is incorrect.
