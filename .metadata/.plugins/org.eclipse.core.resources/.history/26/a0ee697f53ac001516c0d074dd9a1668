xu6:56:36 PM
I am comparing plan 1 and plan2. The only differences between the two is that between the coal and wind powers.

BazaarAgent6:56:40 PM
Hey gaurav, Can you evaluate xu's choice from your perspective of carbon neutrality and economical in the long run ?

Hey xu, Can you evaluate plan 1 from your perspective of environmental friendliness and reliability ?

BazaarAgent6:59:18 PM
Hey gaurav, Can you evaluate plan 2 from your perspective of carbon neutrality and economical in the long run ?

xu6:59:33 PM
Hi Angie, I'm looking at Plan 1 as well.  It seems to be the most balanced and best compromise

sree7:00:07 PM
I like plan 4 instead.

BazaarAgent7:00:16 PM
Hey sree, Can you evaluate plan 4 from your perspective of most economical ?

sree7:00:41 PM
plan 4 bothers me that only one of the options is within what is described as a "tight yearly budget"
