A mouse is a small device used to point to and select items on your computer screen. 
               Although mice come in many shapes, the typical mouse does look a bit like an actual mouse. 
               It's small, oblong, and connected to the system unit by a long wire that resembles a tail. 
               Some newer mice are wireless.

VirtualCarolyn7:26:15 PM
How many buttons a mouse has?

gaurav7:26:18 PM
2

VirtualCarolyn7:26:23 PM
Well done! A mouse usually has two buttons: A primary button (usually the left button) and 
					a secondary button.

A mouse is a small device used to point to and select items on your computer screen. 
               Although mice come in many shapes, the typical mouse does look a bit like an actual mouse. 
               It's small, oblong, and connected to the system unit by a long wire that resembles a tail. 
               Some newer mice are wireless.

VirtualCarolyn7:26:15 PM
How many buttons a mouse has?

gaurav7:26:18 PM
2

VirtualCarolyn7:26:23 PM
Well done! A mouse usually has two buttons: A primary button (usually the left button) and 
					a secondary button.

VirtualCarolyn7:26:23 PM
Let's move on.

VirtualCarolyn7:26:23 PM
When you move the mouse with your hand, what does appear on the screen?
